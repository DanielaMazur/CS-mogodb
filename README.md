### Lab 7: Database Security

- Create a MongoDB database which would contain some secured sensitive data (protected
  via 2-way encryption);
- Create an application which would display the data contained in the database (both
  common data and the decrypted sensitive data);
- Make sure that the sensitive data can only be accessed via your application (i.e. it is
  secure).
